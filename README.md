# Adaptable_Research_Image_De-Noising_Project

Technologies used: Machine Learning (GANs), Python, Django Framework, OpenCV

This project aims to develop an adaptable image de-noising solution for underwater research images. The solution will eliminate the blue water layer and apply image sharpening techniques to enhance image clarity, allowing for meaningful information extraction using pixel extraction. The project will utilize Genrative Adversarial Network(GAN) to create a deep learning model for de-noising, Django framework for linking the model to the frontend, and OpenCV for image capturing. The result will be a user-friendly web interface that allows users to upload and process underwater research images for effective de-noising.
